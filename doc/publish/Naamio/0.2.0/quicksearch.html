The StackThe app has been built to run on Node.js using TypeScript on both the server and client. The reason for this is to enable consistent and easily-manageable code to be written in a modern style across tiers, with the TypeScript transpilation abstracting the complexities of browser implementations and the Node.js roadmap. This is a sacrifice between minimising dependencies and simplifying development. The front-end uses XHTML 5.1 rather than HTML. This enables further extensibility of a strict DOM that can be traversed for syndication by third-parties, and is therefore useable as an undocumented API whilst providing no restrictions or additional requirements on the developer. Reactive Extensions (Rx) are used for the reactive UI for performance and to ensure the footprint on the browser is minimal, (especially when compared to React.js). Pure CSS is used rather than resorted to CSS pre-compilers such as LESS or SASS. The lightweight CSS style used in this product allows inheritence and versatility, without requiring additional dependencies in the build process. The goal will be to provide a server-side optimisation of the CSS and image assets at runtime in due course. The database for the project is RethinkDB, which is a document-based database, using JSON as a storage model. It's fast and scalable, much faster than this project requires, and requires minimum effort to maintain. The web pages are written in markdown and are rendered and cached by the server process.
