# Basic Usage
The `naamio` executable is immediately available in your Terminal window.
You can use this command in a number of ways:

    $ naamio --theme <theme-path>
    # Naamio will load with a specific theme from the <theme-path> folder.

    $ naamio --source <source>
    # The <source> folder will be loaded rather than the relative folder. 

    $ naamio --watch
    # The current site will load, but will continuously look for changes and 
    # hot load them for immediate testing.
