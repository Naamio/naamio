Naamio is the primary web app engine for [Omnijar Studio](https://omnijar.studio "Omnijar Studio"). It has since been extended and developed into a community project under the group name: Naamio (Cloud). It can be extended with templates and applets to rapidly produce web apps.

As a growing number of commercial organizations migrate from other platforms, including _Django_, and _WordPress_, to Naamio – including coffee, financial, and technological companies – we have developed Naamio into a community app development platform for the modern web. 

You can read more in the [official docs](https://naamio.cloud/projects/naamio/manual).
